// Swift lets us use functions just like any other type such as strings and integers. This means you can create a function and assign it to a variable, call that function using that variable, and even pass that function into other functions as parameters.

// Functions used in this way are called closures, and although they work like functions they are written a little differently.

    print("I am driving in my car")
