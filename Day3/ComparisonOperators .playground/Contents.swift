//There are two operators that check for equality: == checks two values are the same, and != (pronounced “not equals”) checks two values are not the same:

firstScore == secondScore
firstScore != secondScore

//There are four operators for comparing whether one value is greater than, less than, or equal to another.

firstScore < secondScore
firstScore >= secondScore

//Each of these also work with strings, because strings have a natural alphabetical order:

"Taylor" <= "Swift"
"Taylor" > "Swift"
