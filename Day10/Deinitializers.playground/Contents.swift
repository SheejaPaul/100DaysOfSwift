// The fourth difference between classes and structs is that classes can have deinitializers – code that gets run when an instance of a class is destroyed.

class Person {
    var name = "John Doe"
    
    init() {
        print("\(name) is alive!")
    }
    
    func printGreeting() {
        print("Hello, I'm \(name)")
    }
    
    deinit {
        print("\(name) is no more!")
    }
}


// We’re going to create a few instances of the Person class inside a loop, because each time the loop goes around a new person will be created then destroyed:

for _ in 1...3 {
    let person = Person()
    person.printGreeting()
}
