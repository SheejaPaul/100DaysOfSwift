//  As well as receiving data, functions can also send back data. To do this, write a dash then a right angle bracket after your functionâ€™s parameter list, then tell Swift what kind of data will be returned.

// Inside your function, you use the return keyword to send a value back if you have one. Your function then immediately exits, sending back that value â€“ no other code from that function will be run.
