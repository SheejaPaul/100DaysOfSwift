import UIKit

//Arrays, sets, and dictionaries are called collections, because they collect values together in one place.

//Dictionay
var teams = [String: String]()

//Array
var results = [Int]()

//Set
var words = Set<String>()

//Swift has special syntax only for dictionaries and arrays; other types must use angle bracket syntax like sets.

//If you wanted, you could create arrays and dictionaries with similar syntax:

let scores = Dictionary<String, String>()
let numbers = Array<Int>()
